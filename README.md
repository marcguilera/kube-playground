# Features
* Hot reload of configuration in spring through configmaps.
* Fast local dev lifecycle with file watching through skaffold.
* Possibility to add other dependencies to the skaffold build to run on a local K8s cluster, similar to docker compose.
* Demo uses spring but anything that can run in a container can benefit from these tools.

# Tools
- minikube is a simple way to run kubernetes clusters locally. we use kubernetes on the cloud so it makes sense to run a similar setup when developing locally.
- skaffold is a tool to aid with kubernetes local development. it mainly consists of a yaml definition which is sort of in between a docker compose and a ci pipeline. in dev mode it watches changes constantly to give us a great feedback loop. testcontainers with kind.
- configmaps are simply a kubernetes object which stores literal data. since itâ€™s kubernetes native it benefits from its crossplane and constant reconciliation. spring cloud has very good integration with it which allows us to have live config updates without redeploys.
